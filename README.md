# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **George Andrade-Munoz**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [X] There is a default tip feature in the settings view that will set the user's tip percentage and the app is able to remember what this tip percentage 
      is throughout app restarts
- [X] There is a dark mode feature the user can select in the settings view

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
This is was my first time working with Swift and the Xcode IDE so everything I implemented was through trail and error and using internet resources and lessons 
in order to implment my app as I envisioned it. Though challenging, working with Swift has opened up a brand new world I am excited to explore in the realm of 
iOS app development!
